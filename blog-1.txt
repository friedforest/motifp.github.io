After months of intense discussion and careful planning, the board of directors decide on today to be Motif's official launch. 
We are very excited to work with our community and discover hidden talents and unique stories. Stay tuned for our very first workshop in November, which we believe will turn out to be very good, so please come and support your local musicians, and get inspired! Generous donations, which will be used to support our local musicians, are graciously accepted. The location is TBD, please check the calendar under "events" for more details. We can't wait to see you there!
